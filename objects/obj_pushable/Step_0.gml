/// @description Frame by Frame for Pushable

//move(self.velocity,0,0) // move script 
//I commented this out becuase the move scipt was crashing becuase of the 
//array stuff I have been working on. We will have to create a seperate 
//move script for this object or we will have to make all of the arrays
//that I made for the player for the obj_pushable (frictions, gravities,etc)
//so that the move script will work for the player AND the obj_pushable
